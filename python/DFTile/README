field_bounaries.py
------------------
This is the first step when generating tiles from the Dragonfly Wide Field Survey coadds.
It loops over the directory that hosts the coadds (/Users/shanydanieli/projects/dwfs/data/df_coadds/) and calculates the boundary (corners) coordinates of each image.
Then it writes the corners into a txt file (/Users/shanydanieli/projects/dwfs/data/) with the name fields_boundaries.txt.

#
#
tiles_centers.py
----------------
This script generates a list of 1 deg x 1 deg tiles spanning the GAMA field covered in the wide field survey.
'dwfs_brick_centers_gama.txt' - a text file that includes the centers of the tiles  (RA and Dec in degrees). This file is also an input of the `tiling.py` script.
'all_bricks_gama.reg' - a region file that includes all tiles in the GAMA field.

In the very near future, I will also add the Stripe82 footprint.

tiling.py
---------
This script does the main tiling work. 
It takes as an input
